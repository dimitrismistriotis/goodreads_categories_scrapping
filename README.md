# README

Wanted to investigate [Goodreads'](https://www.goodreads.com/) categories numbers and play a little bit with Python's html parsing libraries ([Beautiful soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) in this case)

To download book categories html from Goodreads:

```bash
./download_script
```

Then to retrieve data and popuate a CSV with these data:

```bash
./assemble_csv
```

or to do both:

```bash
./download_script && ./assemble_csv
```

## Folders

**examples**: In the examples folder diagrams with most and least popular categories (after placing generated CSV to Google Doc's spreadsheet.

**list_html**: Downloaded files. Commited folder's content in case anyone wants to experiment without retrieving data.
